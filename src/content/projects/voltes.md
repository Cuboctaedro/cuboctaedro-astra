Voltes is a company that organizes sightseeing tours for children and adults in Athens. Their website presents all their offerings and works as a booking system. 

The website is made with Kirby CMS. Kirby offers the flexibility of content types that we needed but most importantly it offers great flexibility in the creation of the backend so that it works not only as CMS but also as a booking management system.
