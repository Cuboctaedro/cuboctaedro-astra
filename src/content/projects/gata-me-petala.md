Gata me Petala is a workshop producing and selling handcrafted jewelry and objects and organizing seminars on jewelry making. I have been responsible for designing and developing their ebsite for a long time and this is its fourth version. For the moment the site does not work as an e-shop but it has been developed with that option in mind and it can be adapted to become one.

The website presents this years collection of jewelry and items as well as all items that are still in production from previous years. There is also a detail presentation of the seminars including a gallery os students' works and a news section. The site jas been build with Kirby CMS.
