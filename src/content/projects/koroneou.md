description: Website for an art gallery in Athens.
order: 010
---

This is a website for an art gallery in Athens. The gallery exists for 25 years so the website has a big archive of exhibition documentation and many artist portfolios and CV's. The gallery used to have a website created using Flash which was good for its time but not functional with today's standards and devices. The back-end was complicated to use and it was desired to implement a better solution that would allow for easier management of the website.

The new website is made using the Kirby CMS which offers a very friendly back-end environment for introducing new material to the site.
